# Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed for beginner developers to practice and improve their coding skills. These projects cover a variety of concepts and provide an excellent opportunity to explore different areas of programming in Python.

## Projects

1. **Calculating Area**
   - A program that calculates the area of various geometric shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles.
   - Allows the user to input the necessary dimensions and provides the calculated area.

2. **File Operations**
   - A program that demonstrates file handling operations in Python.
   - Includes functionality for creating, reading, writing, and appending to text files.

3. **Password Generator**
   - A program that generates secure and random passwords based on user-specified criteria.
   - Allows the user to set the desired password length, include or exclude specific character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and generate multiple passwords.

4. **Text Analyzer**
   - A program that analyzes text data and provides various total count of words and characters.

5. **Age Calculator**
   - A program that calculates a person's age based on their date of birth.
   - Accepts the date of birth as input and displays the calculated age in years, months, and days.

6. **Searching Techniques**
   - A collection of programs that demonstrate different searching algorithms.
   - Includes Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Ternary Search, and Jump Search.
   - Provides an interface for the user to select the search technique and input the necessary data.

7. **Dice Rolling Simulator**
   - A program that simulates the rolling of a dice.
   - Generates a random number between 1 and 6 each time the user rolls the dice.
   - Can be used to simulate multiple dice rolls and displays the results.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the Python file you want to execute using the `python` command followed by the file name.
